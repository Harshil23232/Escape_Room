here is the rubric: Prepare an overview of the proposed marketing communication campaign, noting if and how  promotional programs will differ if there are multiple target markets. Consider your marketing  mix and if to use an undifferentiated, concentrated, and/or differentiated approach. 
Develop a campaign that addresses the components of the promotion mix as noted below. 
o Advertising:  
If planning for television, your commercial may be prepared as a video you produce or in storyboard format. 
It is permissible for your television advertisement to be a YouTube video produced at minimal cost, but you must  then address how you will gain viewers and demonstrate how this medium can  be used effectively to promote the business. In determining media outlets, be  sure to consider reach and frequency as well as cost. 
If planning for print advertising, select an appropriate medium from magazine,  newspaper, direct mail, or out-of-home displays. Be specific as to in what  publication(s) and/or where the advertisement will be placed. 
o Sales Promotion: Items to consider might include coupons and premium items such  as stickers, magnets, etc. 
o Public Relations: Consider corporate-identity materials and publicity as well as other  public relations tools. 
o Other Components - Personal Selling, Social Media, Internet: You must include one  additional element in addition to those noted in the bullet points above. Determine  what is appropriate for the product/service or business based on your target market(s). 

here is our research: Name: Escape-O-Mania

Purpose: Escape-O-Mania is an escape room that builds on the options that you choose throughout. The better choices you make, the harder the intensity of the course. There will also be an arcade for the younger audience.  

The need: The escape room industry is showing exponential growth, which is due to the consumer demand for interactive entertainment experiences. The global escape room market was valued at approximately $7.8 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $21.5 billion by 2030 (https://www.strategicmarketresearch.com/market-report/escape-room-market). Some of the key factors are Experiential Entertainment, meaning consumers who are mostly Millennials and Gen Z, who are increasingly looking for something unique, interactive experiences that provide entertainment (https://www.techsciresearch.com/news/17607-escape-room-market), and Technological Integration, which means the incorporation of advanced technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) which enhancing the immersive quality of an experience, attracting a broader audience (https://www.peekpro.com/blog/latest-escape-room-industry-trends-in-2024). Escape-O-Mania's unique approach, where the difficulty adapts based on players' choice, which fulfills new players and seasoned/advanced players, meaning this will enhance replayability and engagement. Additionally, the addition of an arcade appeals to younger audiences, broadening the customer base. 

Target Market and Segmentation: 
Primary Segments
Young Adults (Ages 18 - 34): The demographic represents the top segment of the consumers who would be willing to go to an escape room. Specifically, individuals aged 25-34 make up 40% of the participants, and consumers aged between 18-24 make up about 30%, which totals up to 70% of the escape room audience (https://gitnux.org/escape-room-statistics).
Families with Children: Since there will be an arcade, it will make Escape-O-Mania appealing to families seeking inclusive entertainment options.
Corporate Clients: Companies looking for business meetings and innovative team-building activities can benefit from the adaptive challenges offered.
Teens: Consumers in the age group between 12-17 try to find a way to go out with their friends, and do something entertaining either during break or during an introduction of something new. 

Segmentation Criteria:
Demographic: Factors like age, family status, and occupation
Psychographic: Lifestyle preferences, such as a desire for interactive and challenging experiences
Behavioral: Frequency of seeking group activities, openness to new entertainment forms
Geographic: Residents within a 30-mile radius of Monmouth Junction, NJ, including nearby urban centers

Factors Impacting the Marketing Environment:

Technological Advancements:

The integration of VR and AR is becoming increasingly prevalent in escape rooms, enhancing the immersive experience and attracting tech-savvy customers and online influencers. 

Competitive Landscapes:
	
The escape room market faces saturation in urban areas, making it essential for new businesses to differentiate themselves through unique themes and experiences, meaning our advantage would be the part where the escape room's difficulty changes with more accurate answers.

Economic Factors:
	
		Consumer spending on activities that are fun and challenging can be based on economic conditions 
which can affect attendance rates, so prices can influence a person's standing in the economic structure.

Regulatory Considerations:

Emergency protocols, participant supervision, approval from OSHA, which must be followed due to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 197, and is responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety and health standards. We would also need a Business License for operating the business, and finally, we would also need to use Zoning and Land Use regulations since we are establishing a physical location. 

Seasonal Demand:

Escape rooms will change in demand based on seasonal factors, meaning targeting market strategies during off-peak periods. Students who are in high school will have to deal with AP exams, finals, and more like the SAT, especially during college application submissions. For adults, there may be times when the stock market is down or the economy is struggling, resulting in lower pay, which can lead to a lower audience rate. Sometimes, there is a possibility of overlap, meaning an even higher emphasis on the market strategy would be necessary. 

Advantages and disadvantages of individuals vs. family branding + branding strategy (Leo)

Individual branding:
	Advantages 
Unique advertisement for each product 
If one product fails it will not harm the entire brand 
Allows each product to have a different image 
		Disadvantages
High cost 
	
	Family branding: 
		Advantages 
Low cost 
Strong brand identity - displays a clear and consistent image across all products 
Increased recognition - consumers are likely recognize the brand image easily 
		Disadvantages
Low flexibility - it is difficult to advertise individual products 
If one product fails, the entire brand image can be affected 

Branding strategy
	Escape-O-Mania will use a family branding strategy. This strategy will allow the company to build a recognizable brand image while reducing marketing costs, increasing customer loyalty, trust, and credibility. 

Factors of pricing decisions + pricing strategy (Bryce)

Price Skimming - Setting prices high as we open our company, then gradually lowering it to meet more reasonable prices. This will cause people to come back as they will believe they are saving money.

Competitive Pricing - Setting prices equal to our competitors. This is a simple pricing strategy that will allow us to operate freely. 

Psychological Pricing - Setting prices to odd numbers, such as 29.99, this number seems lower, even though it’s really 30 dollars, it simply looks more attractive. We can also use this method by allowing people to get a “free” escape room if they purchase two. While we really make a profit from this, as it will lead more people to buy more.

ChatGPT said:
Here’s a complete and detailed answer for #5 and #6 of your marketing communication campaign assignment using your research and aligning it with the concepts taught in Foundations of Business (7th edition):

#5: Overview of Proposed Marketing Communication Campaign
Escape-O-Mania will implement a differentiated marketing strategy, tailoring promotional content and delivery methods to appeal to our four distinct target markets: Young Adults (18–34), Families with Children, Corporate Clients, and Teens (12–17). Each group will receive uniquely crafted messages across appropriate channels while maintaining the consistent brand identity established through our family branding strategy.

Marketing Mix Considerations:

Product: A dynamic escape room that adjusts difficulty based on user choices, plus a separate arcade zone for younger audiences.

Price: A blend of price skimming (initial launch), psychological pricing (e.g., $29.99 instead of $30), and bundled promotions (e.g., "Buy 2, Get 1 Free").

Place: Strategically located in Monmouth Junction, NJ to serve a 30-mile radius, including suburban families and nearby urban professionals.

Promotion: A robust integrated marketing communications plan with tailored strategies across multiple channels to increase reach and engagement.

Promotional programs will differ for each segment:

Young Adults: Emphasis on thrill, challenge, and social experience via social media and influencer content.

Families: Focus on safe, inclusive fun with added arcade benefits using local print ads and school/camp flyers.

Corporate Clients: Highlight team-building and innovation through LinkedIn ads, email marketing, and local business partnerships.

Teens: Drive FOMO (fear of missing out) via TikTok and Instagram Reels, plus seasonal promotions for school breaks.

This differentiated approach ensures that the specific needs and preferences of each market are met effectively while enhancing customer engagement and retention.

#6: Campaign Components – Promotion Mix
Advertising:

Television/YouTube: We will launch a 30-second YouTube video commercial showing a group progressing through Escape-O-Mania’s difficulty levels. The ad will highlight the changing themes and the adaptive nature of the rooms. To build viewership:

Partner with local YouTubers/influencers.

Use Google Ads to promote the video to users within our geographic target zone.

Track reach and frequency via YouTube Analytics.

Print Advertising: We will use:

Out-of-home displays (e.g., digital screens at movie theaters, malls).

Local newspapers like The Princeton Packet and Home News Tribune for family-centric promotion.

Sales Promotion:

Launch-week special: “Escape the Room, Win a Prize!” with coupons for arcade tokens or 10% off your next visit.

Hand out branded magnets, stickers, and “VIP Escapee” cards for repeat customers.

Seasonal bundles: “Family Fun Pack” during summer break, “Holiday Horror Escape” during winter break.

Public Relations:

Develop strong corporate-identity materials: branded uniforms, logo, color scheme (black, purple, silver).

Press releases announcing grand opening, special events, and charity team-up nights.

Partner with local schools and organizations for fundraisers or mental wellness initiatives.

Invite local news and bloggers for media previews and soft launch coverage.

Other Component – Social Media and Internet Marketing:

Build a strong presence on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook with weekly content: teaser videos, behind-the-scenes, and customer testimonials.

Host interactive challenges on TikTok, encouraging users to share their own escape tips and experiences with a hashtag like #EscapeOManiaChallenge.

Launch a mobile-friendly website with booking integration, FAQs, and a virtual tour.

Use email marketing for loyalty programs, birthday discounts, and event invitations.

This comprehensive campaign uses the promotion mix to increase brand awareness, build customer relationships, and drive foot traffic across different consumer segments.

give another example of psycological pricing that js sounds stupid
ChatGPT said:
Here's a deliberately silly example of psychological pricing that sounds stupid but still works because of how human brains interpret numbers:

Escape Room Price: $30
Special Limited Offer: Only $29.97!

That’s just 3 cents off, but people actually perceive it as noticeably cheaper—even though it's basically the same. It sounds almost like, “Wow, it’s under $30!” even though in practice, nobody is saving anything meaningful.

Even goofier:

"Limited Deal: $29.99 + Free Mystery Penny Back!"

It sounds absurd, but now you’ve created intrigue and made $29.99 feel even more “cleverly priced.”

Want a few creative price gimmicks for your campaign or something meme-worthy?
